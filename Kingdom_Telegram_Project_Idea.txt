Project Concept: Kingdoms Telegram

Overview:
Kingdoms Telegram is a Telegram-based game that blends strategy, community building, and play-to-earn mechanics in a fantasy kingdom setting. Every player assumes a role within the realm. Whether rich or poor, each user can participate and profit — either through effort or investment.

Core Gameplay
Upon joining the game, the player is presented with a selection of chests. Each chest contains a unique character with a distinct animation, role, and rarity level. Once a chest is opened, the character is minted as an NFT — tradable and upgradable. Rarer chests contain fewer, more exclusive characters with better design, rare clothing, and unique animations.

Each player can only open one chest per account and may customize their character (including gender selection).

King | 10,000 TON | Rules over the realm. Collects tribute from all Barons. Can organize wars, tournaments, monuments, and festivals.

Dynamic Politics & Warfare
- Kings can declare wars to conquer, defend, or punish.
- If a King loses a war, they lose passive income for 7 days and must pay tribute or cede rights to another King.
- The same kingdoms cannot engage in war more than once per month with each other.
- Wars require hiring more soldiers and mercenaries, fortifying castles, and strategically managing the army.

Resources & Economy
- Basic Resources: Wood, Stone, Fish, Meat.
- Used for building, crafting, and warfare.
- Fish and Meat are required for mining, chopping, and all daily resource collection.
- Construction relies on Wood and Stone (mainly controlled by Barons).
- Trade is handled via decentralized exchange features, led by Traders.

Monetization & Progression
- Free-to-play users can rise through effort: inviting friends, participating in daily tasks, and contributing to wars or religious events.
- Wealthy players can invest to speed up resource collection, gain prestige, and influence the in-game economy.
- All players may trade characters, lands, and items via blockchain — creating an open economy with real-world value.

Vision
Kingdoms Telegram is designed to be more than just a game — it is a mini-society, a living digital economy, where everyone can find their role, rise through merit or wealth, and participate in storytelling, alliances, and conflict.

A project where developers, creators, and players all earn and build together.
